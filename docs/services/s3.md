# S3 / Object storage

## Primary object storage

Primary object storage can be enabled by setting the `PRIMARY=minio` environment variable either in your `.env` file or in `podman-compose.yml` for individual containers.

```bash
podman compose up nextcloud minio
```


## Using mc command line

This can be useful for admin operations like setting a bucket quota on the `nc-external` bucket name:

```
podman compose exec minio mc alias set minio http://localhost:9000 nextcloud nextcloud
podman compose exec minio mc quota set minio/nc-external --size 1k
````
